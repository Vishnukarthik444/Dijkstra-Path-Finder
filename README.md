# Dijkstra Path Finder – Hubli–Dharwad Local Places

This project implements the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path between local train places in the Hubli–Dharwad region. It features a modern JavaScript-based UI, allowing users to select a starting and destination station and visualize the optimal route along with the total distance in kilometers.

The application uses a weighted graph structure to model station connectivity and efficiently finds the shortest path using classic Dijkstra logic. It’s designed to demonstrate core concepts of graph theory, algorithmic problem solving, and interactive frontend development.

This project was developed as part of a college academic project, aiming to apply theoretical concepts in a practical and region-specific use case.
